You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. If you have an online account with us, logging into your account will serve to verify your identity and request, although we may request additional information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought.</p>\n                <p>You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p>\n                <p>The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information, including opting out of the “sale” of their personal information.&nbsp; <span style={{color:\"#3d3c40\"}}>Although we do not believe we engage in the sale of personal information (and have not in the past twelve months) as we currently understand such term to be defined under applicable law and relevant regulatory guidance, we do share information as described in this Policy, including with certain analytics and advertising partners who perform certain services like analyzing our Services and showing you ads for Timezo.&nbsp;</span></p>\n                <p>Depending on how you use the Services, we may share the following categories of information with <span style={{color:\"#3d3c40\"}}>analytics and advertising partners</span>: identification and demographics; device information and identifiers, such as IP address and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; and inference data.
